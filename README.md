### Game description
<i>Daleks game</i> is a game with two types of characters:
- doctor - the main character controlled by a player
- daleks - monsters who want to eat doctor

To get rid of the daleks from the board and win the game, you have to move the doctor in such a way as to collide the distances with each other or with the dead distances. Dead distances (fossils) are formed precisely when distances collide with each other. They are like very sharp stones on the board. You have two power-ups. The first one is a teleport (3 per each board) and bombs (two per each board).

### Control
To move the doctor you can use your mouse or keyboard. The keyboard buttons move Doctor in the right directions:

7  &nbsp;8  &nbsp;9 <br>
4  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 <br>
1  &nbsp;2  &nbsp;3 <br>
- Teleport - "T" or "5" 
- Bombs - "B".
- Restart of the game or next level - "R"
